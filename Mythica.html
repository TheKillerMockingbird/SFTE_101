<h1>Worlds Beyond Reach</h1>
<p>Look up into the night sky. What do you see? The stars look down and watch over you.
 What happens when you go up to meet them? What happens when you go further?
 Keep going, until you find the end. Go beyond that, and you find yourself in someplace new entirely, a new world.
 You continue to climb, going higher and higher, surpassing countless worlds, until you reach the top, the very pinnicle of reality and even past what isn't reality.
 You made it.</p>
<p>There is nowhere higher for you to go.</p>
<p>Or is there?</p>
<p>You can feel there is something above the roof that is holding you down here.
 You just have to break through and find it. With an excruciating amount of effort and pain you break the veil holding you in this place, this prison of reality and that which is not reality.
 You burst through, and you find yourself in a new place, one filled with power and energy. It is more than any world you have visited before.
 You look around, and you realize.
</p>
<p>This is really the top.</p>
<p>Welcome to Mythica, the Highest Plane.</p>

<h2>Power, More Than Your Wildest Dreams</h2>
