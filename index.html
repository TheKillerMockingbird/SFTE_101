    <p>I will work on making this into prettier looking website once I know CSS better, but for now unfortunately this is the best I can do at the moment.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm planning on making a wonderful story one day, but I have to finish college first. After that, I hope you all will be patient enough and willing to experience it someday.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here are some of the characters:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Alebreezin, the Hylowrian princess</li>
        <li>Maddox the Destroyer, father of Alebreezin and the god-king of Hylowray</li>
        <li>Jack Turones, the devoted protecter of Queen Vivian</li>
        <li>Queen Vivian, ruler of the Hivians, a kingdom with tense relations with Hylowray</li>
        <li>Dahliot, an upcoming hero stuck between Hylowray and the Hive</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The world is in danger and no one knows if war can be avoided. A great evil has been working in the shadows and it is up to Dahliot to find it and restore peace between the kingdoms. Can she do it or will all of Mythica fall into war?</p>
    <br>
    <p>I don't have much of it done yet, but it will be great when it is finished.</p>
