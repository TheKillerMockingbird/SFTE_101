    <h2>Born of Two Worlds</h2>
    <p>Dahliot was born to a split household. Her mother was a Hivian and her father was a Hylowrian. When tensions rose between the two kingdoms, Dahliot's parents disagreed on which side to support. Dahliot is torn between her two parents and decides to set out to solve these tensions herself.</p>
    <p>Dahliot, being of mixed lineages, is possibly the best suited person for the job. However, Dahliot does not know what she is doing. She has no formal combat training or diplomatic skill, so she simply makes this up on the go.</p>
