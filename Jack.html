    <h2>Knight of the Hive</h2>
    <p>Jack Turones was born and raised in the Hive, and grew up childhood friends with Vivian. As the two of them grew older, Jack was able to see Vivian less and less due to her royal duties.</p>
    <p>He trained to become a knight and eventually found himself as Vivian's personal guard. He would do anything for her and would willingly give up his life to protect her.</p>
