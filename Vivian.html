    <h2>Ruler of the Hive</h2>
    <p>Vivian is the newly crowned ruler of the Hive, and is the youngest person to have taken the Hivian throne. She grew up with Jack, and she grew quite fond of him, but as she grew older, she had to distance herself from the people in order to fulfill her responsibilities as a royal heir.</p>
    <p>Now that she is Queen, it is her job to protect the Hive, and by the current looking of it, that means going against the Hylowrian Empire.</p>
