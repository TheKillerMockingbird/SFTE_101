<p>I'm a new coder and I want to eventually design video games. I like playing DND as well. I like Metroid and I can't wait for Prime 4. Watch the trailer, it's awesome.</p>

            <h3>Founder of The Highest Plane</h3>
            <p class="lead">I grew up telling and making stories with my siblings using our various toys. At first it didn't really mean much, but as time went on and we got older, the stories we told grew more developed and complex, forming a narritve that stretched over multiple years. This is much like other kids, telling a story or two with their toys growing up, but I decided that the ones we told were worth telling the rest of the world. So, I decided to start writing a book of some of the stories featuring our original characters. Well, telling the story from my point of view anyway. And so, the tale of Mythica and The Highest Plane began.</p>

            <h4>Mon Altissimi Plani</h4>
            <p>I have been running a Dungeons and Dragons campaign for quite a while now, set in a world directly below The Highest Plane. My friends and I have been enjoying it very much. They are currently in a struggle against a foe by the name of Thallaxium, an ancient sea monster from long before humanoids started recording history.</p>
