    <h2>Royalty of Hylowray</h2>
    <p>Alebreezin, or Breez, as she prefers to be called, is one of the children of Emperor Maddox, one of the gods walking the land of Mythica. She leads the armies of Hylowray with valor and skill, bringing fear to her father's enemies and awe to her allies. Most of her body has been replaced by mechanical parts, a testament to her many battles.</p>
    <p>She is very cold, her life having jaded much of her feelings to the point where she is almost sociopathic. With her very few friends, she shows more emotion, laughing along with them. However, even among close friends Alebreezin remains less emotionally expressive than is healthy.</p>
