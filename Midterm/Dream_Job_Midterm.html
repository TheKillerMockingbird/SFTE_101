<p>
    A video game designer is the person or the group of people that create the defining features of video games, such as characters, objectives, rewards, game mechanics, plot, maps, and other parts of creating the concept of a game. They work alongside writers, programmers, artists, and other personnel to create video games.

    The positions are quite varied in this field, and it ranges from meeting with clients, improving the quality of games, creating original ideas, to traiing new members and researching developments in the field.

    I have always enjoyed playing video games growing up, but as I got older it seemed like the average quality of games went down. (Not all games of course) But now having come to the point in my life where I decide what I want to do, I want to become a video game designer so that I can make the games at the quality that I wish I had growing up.
