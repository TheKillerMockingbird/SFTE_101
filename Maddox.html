    <h2>God-King of the strongest nation in Mythica</h2>
    <p>One of the Chaos Trio, Maddox is arguably the most powerful and dangerous entity that resides in Mythica. Consiered a god, he has built an empire that is only rivaled by others built by gods. He leads the Hylowrian Empire with multiple millenia of experience. He has raised five children, though his wife Amaya was slain. The fact that despite all his power he was unable to save her haunts him to this day.</p>
    <p>In his many years of ruling and conquest, Maddox has made many enemies. Chief amoung them is his brother, Teeveax. Teeveax is the one who slew Maddox's wife and has brought ruin and destruction everywhere he has went.</p>
